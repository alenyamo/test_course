Hello!

This is a demo for a possible school program on Genetics.

Files index.html, index4.html, index5.html, index6.html and index7.html - are files with the courses. 
All of them contain the same pdf and links, these extra pages were made to show how it 
would interact with multiple topic class.

After each topic there is a small assesment (index2.html, index8.html, index9.html, index10.html). 
Those files also contain the same quiz and were added to show functionality. During a simple quiz
student would have an option to redo it, redo the topic or move forward. 

After Review (index7.html) and on the list of topic (for fast learners) there is a link to exam (index3.html).
Exam also contains the same quiz for similar reasons, but it has timer on it, after which function,
that counts answers, will be launched automatically. This is the last page of coarse.

For the accessibility were used: alt, semantics, high contrast, text versions of material, link names.

JavaScript code was not big enough to move it into the separate file, although in big project
with more code and more pages a simple link to the file with all functions would be a better 
solution.

Main source for responsiveness was Bootstrap Grid system. Bootstrap also was the main tool for design.

Design itself is very simple. Main reason for that was that it would be a study program. It does not
really need more to is, as long as students can access the material easily (in my case through embed pdf,
downloaded text or presentation version and additional links).
